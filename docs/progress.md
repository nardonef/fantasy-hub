# Fantasy League Hub — Progress Tracker

> **Last updated**: 2026-04-02
> **Current phase**: V2 — AI Chat (complete, pending iOS end-to-end test with real auth)
> **Goal**: ChatGPT-style natural language interface for league history, scoped to a single league

---

## V1 — Core Analytics

### 1. Project Setup & Infrastructure

- [x] Initialize SwiftUI Xcode project (iOS 17+, Swift 6.0, XcodeGen)
- [x] Set up Node.js Express API (TypeScript) with project structure
- [x] Design Prisma schema (users, leagues, seasons, managers, matchups, standings, draft_picks, transactions, sync_jobs)
- [x] Configure BullMQ job queue with Redis connection
- [x] Scaffold Clerk auth middleware (Express side)
- [x] Implement Broadcast Dark + Trophy Gold design system (`Theme.swift`)
- [x] Provision PostgreSQL database and run `prisma migrate` (postgresql@17, fantasy_hub db, 13 tables)
- [x] Set up Redis instance (redis 8.6.1 via Homebrew)
- [x] Configure Clerk project (real API keys in api/.env, dev bypass auto-disables)
- [ ] Set up deployment pipeline (API hosting)

### 2. Data Layer & Provider Integration

- [x] Build provider adapter interface (`src/providers/types.ts`)
- [x] Implement Sleeper adapter (full: leagues, matchups, draft picks, standings)

- [x] Implement invite link system (API: generate/preview/join endpoints, iOS: deep links via fantasyhub:// URL scheme, InviteView, share sheet)
- [x] Fix Yahoo manager identity mapping — nickname-based identity keys instead of unstable numeric slot IDs (`yahoo.ts`, `types.ts`)
- [x] Add full-sync data cleanup — wipe all league data before re-import when identity keys change (`sync-league.ts`)
- [x] Add transaction persistence to sync job (`sync-league.ts`)
- [x] Compute `madePlayoffs` from PLAYOFF/CHAMPIONSHIP matchup participation (`sync-league.ts`)
- [x] Persist `seasonLeagueIds` in league metadata and pass through on re-sync (`leagues.ts`)

### 3. iOS App — Core Navigation & Onboarding

- [x] Build 5-tab navigation (Dashboard, Analytics, Chat placeholder, League, Profile) + hidden native tab bar fix
- [x] Build league switcher in navigation
- [x] Build progressive onboarding flow (welcome → provider → connect → select → import)
- [x] Build sign-in view
- [x] Integrate Clerk iOS SDK (ClerkKit + ClerkKitUI, real auth via AuthView, session tokens for API requests)
- [x] Build league invite link flow (deep links via fantasyhub://invite/{code})
- [x] Implement skeleton → stats animate-in during import (ImportProgressView with staged animations)

- [x] **Insights Backend** — `GET /analytics/insights` endpoint with 7 generators (streaks, rivalries, consistency, clutch, records, PPG comparison, heartbreak), 1-hour in-memory cache
- [x] **Insight Models** — `InsightsResponse`, `InsightItem`, `InsightType` enum (10 types) in `LeagueModels.swift`

- [x] **Simulator Validated** — all 3 features rendering correctly with real league data (Blake's Shoes, 14 seasons)

### 9c. Auth Session Handling

- [x] **401 Retry with Token Refresh** — `APIClient.request()` retries once on 401 with refreshed Clerk token, coalesces concurrent refresh calls via `activeRefreshTask`
- [x] **`APIError.sessionExpired`** — new error case thrown only after retry fails, with `isAuthError` computed property
- [x] **Session Expiry Signaling** — `AsyncStream<Void>` from APIClient to AuthManager crosses actor boundary cleanly
- [x] **AuthManager Listener** — `@Published var sessionExpired` driven by `AsyncStream`, `acknowledgeSessionExpiry()` for dismiss
- [x] **Root-Level Alert** — `.alert("Session Expired")` on `FantasyHubApp` root Group — overlays current screen, no abrupt navigation
- [x] **Zero View Changes** — all retry/expiry logic centralized in APIClient + AuthManager, no individual view modifications needed

### 9d. Sleeper Adapter Fixes

- [x] **Full Season Discovery** — `getLeagues()` now follows `previous_league_id` chain to discover all historical seasons (was limited to 3 years)
- [x] **`seasonLeagueIds` for Sleeper** — maps year → Sleeper league ID (like Yahoo), so sync uses correct league ID per season
- [x] **Bracket-Based Champion Detection** — `getSeasonData()` uses `/winners_bracket` endpoint to find actual playoff champion (was incorrectly using regular-season #1 seed)
- [x] **Sync Route Season Merge** — `POST /sync` merges seasons from DB with `seasonLeagueIds` metadata, so newly discovered seasons are included in re-syncs
- [x] **BIG12 Re-sync Validated** — 4 seasons (2022-2025), correct champions (franknardone 2022+2024), 30-26-0 all-time record, all features rendering in simulator with real Clerk auth

### 10. Polish & Launch

- [x] End-to-end testing with real Sleeper league data (BIG12 league: 12 managers, 98 matchups, 36 draft picks — all 8 analytics endpoints verified)
- [x] End-to-end testing with real Yahoo league data (Blake's Shoes: 12 managers, 98 matchups, 192 draft picks, 686 transactions — Yahoo OAuth + adapter verified)
- [x] Re-sync Blake's Shoes with nickname-based identity fix (31 managers: 15 core + 16 one-season anon/hidden profiles, 3466 transactions imported, correct champion attribution)
- [x] Performance optimization (lazy per-section loading in AnalyticsView, paginated activity feed, API pagination on activity/extremes/scoring)
- [x] Error handling (ErrorStateView with retry on all analytics + dashboard views)
- [x] Loading states on all analytics detail views + analytics main view
- [x] Fix year display formatting — no comma separators (2025 not 2,025)
- [x] Fix native tab bar bleeding through behind custom tab bar
- [x] Shimmer/skeleton loading states (ShimmerView + DashboardSkeleton, AnalyticsSkeleton, StandingsSkeleton, GenericListSkeleton)
- [ ] App Store assets and submission
